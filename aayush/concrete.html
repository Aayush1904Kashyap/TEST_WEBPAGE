<div class="description"><p>Concrete is one of the most common construction materials. It is a composite material from fine and coarse aggregate mixed with a binder like cement and water. The mixture is then left to cure and set over time. Concrete takes seven days to cure and an average of 28 days to attain maximum strength. Reinforced concrete is most common in construction, whereby steel is embedded in the concrete to increase the structural tensile strength. Concrete comes in many forms, with examples such as lightweight concrete and waterproof concrete. The project type dictates the type of concrete used. One of the most significant advantages of concrete is that it can be poured into any shape and hardened into a stone-like material</p></div>
