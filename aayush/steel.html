<h1>STEEL</h1>
<div class="img"><img src=steel.jpg></div>
<div class="description"><p>The construction of skyscrapers exploded from our discovery of steel as a reinforcement material. Steel is a composite material made from alloys of iron and carbon. Steel has high strength and functionality.  It is also lightweight, easy to work with, and cheaper to ship than other building materials. Steel does not easily deform unless we place a tremendous amount of weight on it, and it retains its structural properties even when it is bent. Due to its structural stability, we use steel to make tall modern buildings' structural frameworks</p></div>
